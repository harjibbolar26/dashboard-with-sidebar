# About the project

This project is a clone of this [ThemesForest](https://demos.themeselection.com/materio-bootstrap-html-admin-template/html/vertical-menu-template/) page made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and tailwind css.

The main focus of the project is the sidebar menu and its incorporation with the Navbar and Maian content.

The only library used is [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/).

Thank you for checking out.
